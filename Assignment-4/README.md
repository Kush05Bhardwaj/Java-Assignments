### Project Description

This project is a console-based **Student Record System** developed using Java.  
It demonstrates the concepts of **inheritance**, **ArrayList collections**, **method overriding**, and **input validation**.  
The application allows users to add multiple student records, calculate grades automatically, and display all stored records through a menu-driven interface.

---

### Objectives
- To implement **inheritance** using a parent `Person` class and a child `Student` class.
- To apply **dynamic data storage** using `ArrayList`.
- To demonstrate **method overriding** with the `toString()` method.
- To validate user input for marks and handle menu-driven navigation.
- To reinforce object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation and class interaction.

---

### Features
- **Inheritance Concept:**  
  `Student` extends `Person`, reusing the `name` attribute from the parent class.

- **Menu-Driven System:**  
  Users can:  
  - Add a new student  
  - Display all students  
  - Exit the application

- **Automatic Grade Calculation:**  
  Based on marks:  
  - A → 90–100  
  - B → 75–89  
  - C → 50–74  
  - D → Below 50

- **Input Validation:**  
  Ensures marks lie between **0 and 100**, otherwise asks for re-entry.

- **ArrayList-Based Storage:**  
  Stores multiple student objects dynamically without size limitations.

- **Polymorphism via `toString()` Override:**  
  Displays student details in a clean, formatted manner.
